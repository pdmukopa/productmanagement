            Passionate programmers is a group of passionate programmers as the name itself tells. It was found by a developer of the name of prince david in 2010. This group was developed to help beginners in programming to improve on their programming skills. Other than that, this group was also developed for collaboration. The developer himself discovered that programming alone is very difficult, it requires collaboration with other programmers.
